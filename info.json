    "description": "This mod is the opposite of 'expensive' recipe and technology settings and reduces the prices of things in the 'normal' price settings. Prices are reduced in the same ratio by which they would be increased with the 'expensive' settings. Since the 'expensive' technology recipes are the same as 'normal', this mod simply reduces the technology costs by approximately 4, since the official Marathon settings use a technology price multiplier of 4."
